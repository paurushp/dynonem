Package: dnem
Version: 0.1.1
Title: Modeling the temporal interplay of molecular signaling and gene expression
Author: Benedict Anchang <benedict.anchang@klinik.uni-regensburg.de>
Description: The package 'dnem' estimates  signal propagation rates in a network from time series data of perturbation effects using gibbs sampling. We denote the signaling genes or perturbed genes as S-genes and the effect genes as E-genes. dnem takes as input (1.) a transitively closed directed graph, representing a hypothetical pathway , and (2.) binary time series high-dimensional phenotypic readout of perturbation effects (e.g. gene expression or morphological profiles). The output is a non necessarily transitive directed graph representing the phenotypic hierarchy with edges representing the rate of signal flow.
